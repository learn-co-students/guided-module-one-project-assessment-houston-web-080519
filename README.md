 # Welcome to the MadLib CLI App! 
This is a project I designed and completed while attending Flatiron School to show off some of the concepts I learned in the first three weeks.

 ## How to Install:

Fork this repository. Copy the SSH key. In your computer's terminal, type the command:

git clone {SSH key}

Open the file in the editor of your choice.

 ## How to Run:

Once opened in the editor of your choice, run the command

ruby ./bin/index.rb

The terminal should then display two Mad Lib story options to choose from.

 ## How to Use:

 Select a story using up and down arrows and hitting 'return' on your keyboard. Type in random words that correlate with the part of speech you are prompted with. When all of the prompts are completed, your story will be returned to you with your chosen inputs.

## Authors and Acknowledgment

Thanks to Scott Ungchusri and Joshua Miles for looking over my work, partner coding at times, and giving feedback on how to make my app look clean. Thanks for helping me achieve my vision for this project. Y'all are excellent teachers and mentors!


Enjoy!
